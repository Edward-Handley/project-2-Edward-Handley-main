# Project 2 - Database Development
## Introduction
In this task you are going to use the Systems Development Life Cycle to develop a working software system with a database backend. You will identify an area where a new system may be needed, conduct research into the system requirements and then develop a prototype for that system.

You will need to find a contact that works for a company that may have need for a suitable system, or currently has a similar system that you could base your project on. Once you have identified a suitable system, you will need to conduct appropriate research into how the system currently works and what the requirements of a new system will be. This research should include appropriate data gathering using techniques such as interviews, surveys and questionnaires.

Once you have conducted your research, you are to produce a model of the current system and develop a list of detailed system requirements. From this list of requirements, you are to design a system and then develop the software using the Software Development Cycle. This software will be based on a database that will use a form-query-report model that will allow users to enter data into the database, search for relevant information and extract that information in the form of a report.

In creating your software system, it is recommend you use either:

* the Bottle framework with SQLite
* A combination of HTML/CSS/Python and SQLite using Python CGI

NOTE: It is preferred you use Bottle as CGI is an old technology that is being removed from the Python libraries soon.

If you wish to use a different framework then discuss this with your teacher. NOTE: Only limited technical support will be provided if you choose to use a differentÂ framework.
